## Download and Install R and RStudio

- Install the R Software 

    Go to http://cran.rstudio.com/ and click on Download R for Windows (or MacOS), click on install R for the first time and download R. When the file is done downloading, double click  “R-4.1.2-win.exe” (or apporiate installation file for your OS) to install the file and select Run, and continue with the installation wizard.
    
- Install Rstudio Desktop

    There are many ways to interface with R from the bare-bones base R software, RStudio, or R Commander (a GUI wrapper for base R). We will be using RStudio for our labs. In order to install RStudio Desktop visit http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download and download RStudio Desktop (free version) for your operating system.

    If you already have R and/or RStudio installed on your computer, it is a good idea to check their version and update it to the latest version (R 4.1.2 and RStudio 2021.09.1-372 as of January 2022) if they aren't.
    
    If you are using an iPad/tablet, you can register a free RStudio Cloud account at https://rstudio.cloud/plans/free, and use a browser to access RStudio from your iPad/tablet. Free account is sufficient for our purpose; let me know if you hit the time/resource cap of free account later in the term when we start to work on the class project.


## Introduction to R and RStudio

Adapted from [R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis by Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/01-rstudio-intro/)

We’ll be using RStudio: a free, open source R Integrated Development Environment (IDE). It provides a built-in editor, works on all platforms (including on servers) and provides many advantages such as integration with version control and project management.

### Basic layout

When you first open RStudio, you will be greeted by three panels:

- The interactive R console/Terminal (entire left)
- Environment/History/Connections (tabbed in upper right)
- Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer (tabbed in lower right)

![](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/fig/01-rstudio.png)

Once you open files, such as R scripts, an editor panel will also open in the top left.

![](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/fig/01-rstudio-script.png)
## Workflow within RStudio
There are two main ways one can work within RStudio:

1. Test and play within the interactive R console then copy code intoa .R file to run later.
   *  This works well when doing small tests and initially starting off.
   *  It quickly becomes laborious
2. Start writing in a .R file and use RStudio's short cut keys for the Run command to push the current line, selected lines or modified lines to the interactive R console.
   * This is a great way to start; all your code is saved for later
   * You will be able to run the file you create from within RStudio or using R's `source()`  function.


> ## Tip: Running segments of your code
>
> RStudio offers you great flexibility in running code from within the editor
> window. There are buttons, menu choices, and keyboard shortcuts. To run the
> current line, you can
> 1. click on the `Run` button above the editor panel, or
> 2. select "Run Lines" from the "Code" menu, or
> 3. hit Ctrl+Return in Windows or Linux or Command+Return on Mac OS.
> (This shortcut can also be seen by hovering
> the mouse over the button). To run a block of code, select it and then `Run`.
> If you have modified a line of code within a block of code you have just run,
> there is no need to reselect the section and `Run`, you can use the next button
> along, `Re-run the previous region`. This will run the previous code block
> including the modifications you have made.


## Introduction to R

Much of your time in R will be spent in the R interactive
console. This is where you will run all of your code, and can be a
useful environment to try out ideas before adding them to an R script
file. This console in RStudio is the same as the one you would get if
you typed in `R` in your command-line environment.

The first thing you will see in the R interactive session is a bunch
of information, followed by a ">" and a blinking cursor. In many ways
this is similar to the shell environment you learned about during the
shell lessons: it operates on the same idea of a "Read, evaluate,
print loop": you type in commands, R tries to execute them, and then
returns a result.

### Using R as a calculator

The simplest thing you could do with R is to do arithmetic:

```{r addition_1}
1 + 100
```

And R will print out the answer, with a preceding "[1]". Don't worry about this
for now, we'll explain that later. For now think of it as indicating output.

If you type in an incomplete command, R will wait for you to complete it:

> > 1 +
> +

Any time you hit return and the R session shows a "+" instead of a ">", it
means it's waiting for you to complete the command. If you want to cancel
a command you can hit Esc and RStudio will give you back the ">" prompt.

> ## Tip: Canceling commands
>
> If you're using R from the command line instead of from within RStudio,
> you need to use Ctrl+C instead of Esc
> to cancel the command. This applies to Mac users as well!
>
> Canceling a command isn't only useful for killing incomplete commands:
> you can also use it to tell R to stop running code (for example if it's
> taking much longer than you expect), or to get rid of the code you're
> currently writing.
>


When using R as a calculator, the order of operations is the same as you
would have learned back in school.

From highest to lowest precedence:

 * Parentheses: `(`, `)`
 * Exponents: `^` or `**`
 * Multiply: `*`
 * Divide: `/`
 * Add: `+`
 * Subtract: `-`

```{r operator1}
3 + 5 * 2
```

Use parentheses to group operations in order to force the order of
evaluation if it differs from the default, or to make clear what you
intend.

```{r operator2}
(3 + 5) * 2
```

This can get unwieldy when not needed, but clarifies your intentions.
Remember that others may later read your code.

```{r operator3, eval=FALSE}
(3 + (5 * (2 ^ 2))) # hard to read
3 + 5 * 2 ^ 2       # clear, if you remember the rules
3 + 5 * (2 ^ 2)     # if you forget some rules, this might help
```


The text after each line of code is called a
"comment". Anything that follows after the hash (or octothorpe) symbol
`#` is ignored by R when it executes code.

Really small or large numbers get a scientific notation:

```{r sci1}
2/10000
```

Which is shorthand for "multiplied by `10^XX`". So `2e-4`
is shorthand for `2 * 10^(-4)`.

You can write numbers in scientific notation too:

```{r sci2}
5e3  # Note the lack of minus here
```

### Mathematical functions

R has many built in mathematical functions. To call a function,
we can type its name, followed by open and closing parentheses.
Anything we type inside the parentheses is called the function's
arguments:

```{r function1}
sin(1)  # trigonometry functions
```

```{r function2}
log(1)  # natural logarithm
```

```{r function3}
log10(10) # base-10 logarithm
```

```{r function4}
exp(0.5) # e^(1/2)
```

Don't worry about trying to remember every function in R. You
can look them up on Google, or if you can remember the
start of the function's name, use the tab completion in RStudio.

This is one advantage that RStudio has over R on its own, it
has auto-completion abilities that allow you to more easily
look up functions, their arguments, and the values that they
take.

Typing a `?` before the name of a command will open the help page
for that command. When using RStudio, this will open the 'Help' pane;
if using R in the terminal, the help page will open in your browser.
The help page will include a detailed description of the command and
how it works. Scrolling to the bottom of the help page will usually
show a collection of code examples which illustrate command usage.
We'll go through an example later.

### Comparing things

We can also do comparisons in R:

```{r  comparing1}
1 == 1  # equality (note two equals signs, read as "is equal to")
```

```{r comparing2}
1 != 2  # inequality (read as "is not equal to")
```

```{r comparing3}
1 < 2  # less than
```

```{r comparing4}
1 <= 1  # less than or equal to
```

```{r comparing5}
1 > 0  # greater than
```

```{r comparing6}
1 >= -9 # greater than or equal to
```

### Variables and assignment

We can store values in variables using the assignment operator `<-`, like this:

```{r variable1}
x <- 1/40
```

Notice that assignment does not print a value. Instead, we stored it for later
in something called a **variable**. `x` now contains the **value** `0.025`:

```{r variable2}
x
```

More precisely, the stored value is a *decimal approximation* of
this fraction called a [floating point number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point).

Look for the `Environment` tab in the top right panel of RStudio, and you will see that `x` and its value
have appeared. Our variable `x` can be used in place of a number in any calculation that expects a number:

```{r variable3}
log(x)
```

Notice also that variables can be reassigned:

```{r variable4}
x <- 100
```

`x` used to contain the value 0.025 and now it has the value 100.

Assignment values can contain the variable being assigned to:

```{r variable5}
x <- x + 1 #notice how RStudio updates its description of x on the top right tab
y <- x * 2
```

The right hand side of the assignment can be any valid R expression.
The right hand side is *fully evaluated* before the assignment occurs.

Variable names can contain letters, numbers, underscores and periods but no spaces. They
must start with a letter or a period followed by a letter (they cannot start with a number nor an underscore).
Variables beginning with a period are hidden variables.
Different people use different conventions for long variable names, these include

  * periods.between.words
  * underscores\_between_words
  * camelCaseToSeparateWords

What you use is up to you, but **be consistent**.

It is also possible to use the `=` operator for assignment:

```{r variable6}
x = 1/40
```

But this is much less common among R users.  The most important thing is to
**be consistent** with the operator you use. There are occasionally places
where it is less confusing to use `<-` than `=`, and it is the most common
symbol used in the community. So the recommendation is to use `<-`.

#### Challenge 1

Which of the following are valid R variable names?
```{r ch0, eval=FALSE}
min_height
max.height
_age
.mass
MaxLength
min-length
2widths
celsius2kelvin
```

### Vectorization

One final thing to be aware of is that R is *vectorized*, meaning that
variables and functions can have vectors as values. In contrast to physics and
mathematics, a vector in R describes a set of values in a certain order of the
same data type. For example

```{r vector1}
1:5
2^(1:5)
x <- 1:5
2^x
```

This is incredibly powerful; we will discuss this further in an
upcoming lesson.


### Managing your environment

There are a few useful commands you can use to interact with the R session.

`ls` will list all of the variables and functions stored in the global environment
(your working R session):

```{r env1}
ls()
```

> ## Tip: hidden objects
>
> Like in the shell, `ls` will hide any variables or functions starting
> with a "." by default. To list all objects, type `ls(all.names=TRUE)`
> instead
>


Note here that we didn't give any arguments to `ls`, but we still
needed to give the parentheses to tell R to call the function.

If we type `ls` by itself, R prints a bunch of code instead of a listing of objects.

```{r env2}
ls
```

What's going on here?

Like everything in R, `ls` is the name of an object, and entering the name of
an object by itself prints the contents of the object. The object `x` that we
created earlier contains `x`:

```{r env3}
x
```

The object `ls` contains the R code that makes the `ls` function work! We'll talk
more about how functions work and start writing our own later.

You can use `rm` to delete objects you no longer need:

```{r env4, eval=FALSE}
rm(x)
```

If you have lots of things in your environment and want to delete all of them,
you can pass the results of `ls` to the `rm` function:

```{r env6, eval=FALSE}
rm(list = ls())
```

In this case we've combined the two. Like the order of operations, anything
inside the innermost parentheses is evaluated first, and so on.

In this case we've specified that the results of `ls` should be used for the
`list` argument in `rm`. When assigning values to arguments by name, you *must*
use the `=` operator!!

If instead we use `<-`, there will be unintended side effects, or you may get an error message:

```{r env7, error=TRUE}
rm(list <- ls())
```

> ## Tip: Warnings vs. Errors

## R Packages

One of the advantages of R is the thousands packages that extend the functionailities of base R. A major part of learning R is to learn to work with R packages. Besides the base R, we will use a suite of packages named [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) that covers the whole process of data analysis. To install the `tidyverse` packages, you can run R function in RStudio's **Console** panel: 

```{r install1, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")

# Caution: the tidyverse package has a lot of dependencies 
# and may take a while to install
```

To use R packages you have installed, include this line in your script or in the Console:

```{r install2, eval=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
# Note here the quotation marks are optional and
# it is the same as
library(tidyverse)
```

* You can update installed packages by typing `update.packages()`
* You can remove a package with `remove.packages("tidyverse")`

Packages can also be viewed, loaded, and detached in the Packages tab of the lower right panel in RStudio. Clicking on this tab will display all of the installed packages with a checkbox next to them. If the box next to a package name is checked, the package is loaded and if it is empty, the package is not loaded. Click an empty box to load that package and click a checked box to detach that package.

Packages can be installed and updated from the Package tab with the Install and Update buttons at the top of the tab.

## Tasks

### Challenge 1

What will be the value of each variable  after each
statement in the following program?

```{r ch1, eval=FALSE, exercise=TRUE}
mass <- 47.5
age <- 122
mass <- mass * 2.3
age <- age - 20
```


## Challenge 2
Run the code from the previous challenge, and write a command to
compare mass to age. Is mass larger than age?

```{r ch2, eval=FALSE, exercise=TRUE}
mass
age
```

### Challenge 3

Clean up your working environment by deleting the mass and age
variables.
```{r ch3, eval=FALSE, exercise=TRUE}
?rm
```

### Challenge 4

Install the following packages: `ggplot2` and `gapminder`
```{r ch4, eval=FALSE, exercise=TRUE}

```
